# Youtube-Mixtapes

Ruby script that uses the Yt gem to create weekly mixtape playlists from a list of channels. This is a quick script I put together after Youtube removed their Collections feature a couple months ago. I run this script once a week on my Macbook using Keyboard Maestro. It allows me to just listen through all of the latest uploads from the channels I like. Feel free to copy this and use it to your heart's content. There are some goofy issues getting all of your Google API credentials and OAuth refresh token setup. If you are having trouble, let me know I may be able to help.

Happy listening!
